    <p id="para"><span class=ipsum>Lorem Ipsum</span> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. <span class=ipsum>Lorem Ipsum</span> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the <span class=dates>1500s,</span> when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <span class=dates>1960s</span> with the release of Letraset sheets containing <span class=ipsum>Lorem Ipsum</span> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like <span id="names">Aldus PageMaker</span> including versions of <span class=ipsum>Lorem Ipsum</span></p>
